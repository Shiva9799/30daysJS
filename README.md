# 🚀 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge 🚀

Welcome to my **30 Days of JavaScript** journey! Over the next month, I'll be diving deep into the world of JavaScript, building a strong foundation, and creating exciting projects. Every day, I'll tackle a new challenge, from basic syntax to advanced concepts, ensuring that I master JavaScript inside and out.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- **HTML**: Structuring the content and providing the foundation for each project.
- **CSS**: Styling the web pages, making sure they are visually appealing and responsive.
- **JavaScript**: The star of the show! I'll be focusing on ES6+ features, DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming, and more.

## 🎯 Objectives:
1. **Daily Challenges**: Each day, I’ll solve a JavaScript challenge or build a mini-project to reinforce my learning.
2. **Code Snippets**: I’ll share useful code snippets and explanations to help others understand key concepts.
3. **Project Showcase**: By the end of the 30 days, I’ll have a collection of projects demonstrating my progress and skills.

## 📅 Timeline:
- **Day 1-10**: Basics of JavaScript, Data Types, Functions, and Loops.
- **Day 11-20**: DOM Manipulation, Events, and API Integration.
- **Day 21-30**: Advanced Topics like Async/Await, Promises, and ES6+ Features.
